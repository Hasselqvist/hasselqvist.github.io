I am a postdoctoral researcher (six years) in the [Crime, Labor and Inequality Department](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.914985.en/crime__labor_and_inequality.html) at [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/en), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University. I conduct research in labor economics, with a focus on education, family and migration. My current work investigates parental investments and gender gaps, the integration of migrant children and families, and issues related to family structure and child custody.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from [LMU Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en).
