I am a phd candidate at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University. My research focuses on Labor Economics, including topics on education, family and migration.

My current work investigates parental investments and gender gaps, the integration of migrant children and families, and issues related to family structure and child custody.

In the fall of 2025 I will be joining the [Crime, Labor and Inequality Department](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.914985.en/crime__labor_and_inequality.html) at [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/en).
